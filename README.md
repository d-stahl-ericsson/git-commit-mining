# git-commit-mining
Scripts for mining and collating Git commit data for research purposes.

This will not be the most beautiful piece of code you ever laid eyes on. It is fairly hacky and copy-pasty, but given a Git repository it will give you a table of commits with respective attributes per commit within a specified time interval. Provided as is, without guarantees or claims of any kind :) Any efforts to clean up, optimize, bugfix or otherwise improve are welcome!

## Usage
* Run `gitlyze.py -h` for a list of arguments and their usage.
* To include contribution to critically complex functions in the analysis, provide a .csv of such functions as input. This can be generated by `find-complex-functions.py`. Similarly to `gitlyze.py`, run `find-complex-functions.py` for help on correct argument usage.

## Dependencies
The scripts require the [GitPython](https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/), [editdistance](https://pypi.org/project/editdistance/) and [Lizard](https://pypi.org/project/lizard/) modules to run.
